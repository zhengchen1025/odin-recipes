<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Roasted broccoli is easy to make and so much more flavorsome than boiled. My
  favorite part is the roasted sliced stem pieces.
</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>14 ounces broccoli</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
  <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
  <li>
    Cut broccoli florets from the stalk. Peel the stalk and slice into 1/4-inch
    slices. Mix florets and stem pieces with olive oil in a bowl and transfer to
    a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper.
  </li>
  <li>Roast in the preheated oven until broccoli is tender and lightly browned, about 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
</ol>
